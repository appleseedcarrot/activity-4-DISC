# Note from Christian

Vite was uesd to run the server because create-react-app was deprecated and had lots of errors when running. Hope this solution works for you easily as well
# Explore Page

The page I created for this assignment is the explore page where users will be able to post their room setups for inspiration, for fun, and to meet new potential roommates. 

# What's working

- Everything from hw-4
- Explore page now has a brief list of users with a button that takes you to another page with all the users
- Clicking on a user brings them to their individual profile
- You can now click on the Logo to go to a (new) homepage, same with the Explore link to navigate to the explore page.
- Footer links do the same as above^.

# What's not working
You still can not sort or create a new post yet.
