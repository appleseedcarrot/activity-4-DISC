# Homework 5

- Added a new section in the Explore page where you can see a brief summary of the users. These users are being fetched from the database provided by DISC.
- Didn't implement deleting, creating, or updating users -> Saving for later when we create our own database
- Frontend fetches from the provided database routes. Only used the GET method but plan to add more later on when I understand it better.
- Added two more new pages -> All users and detailed users pages. You can click on the see more users button in the explore page to see all the users. Clicking on any profile brings you to their detailed profile page.
- Pages route to eachother using <Link> component. Nice
- There's probably more but let me know if there are questions.
