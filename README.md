# Explore Page

The page I created for this assignment is the explore page where users will be able to post their room setups for inspiration, for fun, and to meet new potential roommates. 

# What's working

As of now, the basic format of the site is setup and you can actually click on filters to select posts that are of that genre of rooms. I have made some example posts just to showcase this function.

# What's not working
You can not sort or create a new post yet.
