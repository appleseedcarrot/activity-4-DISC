All the code is here for you to see.
- Note: Updating profile and creating a new post doesn't work for some reason. I couldn't figure out how to fix it in time, but tldr the backend wasn't properly parsing form data (or any data at all even with JSON for some reason). I have made example posts as such to showcase what it's supposed to look like
- For homework 9, I have converted CreatePost.jsx into Typescript
